# ✅ FIXED - Build Guide

## Issue Fixed

Next.js was trying to build microservices code. Now they're separated.

## Changes Made

1. **tsconfig.json** - Excluded microservices from Next.js TypeScript
2. **next.config.js** - Excluded microservices from webpack watch
3. **Separate build scripts** - Independent builds

## Build Options

### Option 1: Build Everything
```bash
BUILD_ALL.bat
```
Builds both Next.js and Microservices

### Option 2: Build Next.js Only
```bash
BUILD_NEXTJS.bat
```
or
```bash
npm run build
```

### Option 3: Build Microservices Only
```bash
BUILD_MICROSERVICES.bat
```

### Option 4: Build Microservices Individually
```bash
cd microservices/auth-service
npm install
npm run build

cd ../file-service
npm install
npm run build

cd ../report-service
npm install
npm run build
```

## Start Services

### Start Everything
```bash
START_EVERYTHING.bat
```
Starts both Next.js and all microservices

### Start Microservices Only
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d
```

### Start Next.js Only
```bash
npm start
```

## Test Build

### Test Next.js Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Should complete without errors about microservices

### Test Microservices Build
```bash
BUILD_MICROSERVICES.bat
```
Should build all 3 services and Docker images

## Verify

### Check Next.js Build
```bash
npm run build
```
✓ Should NOT see errors about 'express' or microservices

### Check Microservices
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml build
```
✓ Should build all images successfully

### Check Running Services
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml ps
```
✓ Should show 19 services

## Architecture

```
Project Root
├── app/                    ← Next.js (npm run build)
├── components/             ← Next.js
├── services/               ← Next.js
├── microservices/          ← Separate build (BUILD_MICROSERVICES.bat)
│   ├── auth-service/       ← npm run build (inside service)
│   ├── file-service/       ← npm run build (inside service)
│   └── report-service/     ← npm run build (inside service)
└── python-backend/         ← Docker build only
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Build Next.js
npm run build

# Build Microservices
BUILD_MICROSERVICES.bat

# Build Everything
BUILD_ALL.bat

# Start Everything
START_EVERYTHING.bat

# Test Integration
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS.bat
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Next.js still tries to build microservices:
1. Delete `.next` folder
2. Run `npm run build` again

### If microservices don't build:
1. Check each service has node_modules
2. Run `npm install` in each service folder
3. Run `npm run build` in each service folder

### If Docker build fails:
1. Check Dockerfiles exist
2. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml build --no-cache`

## Success Criteria

✅ `npm run build` completes without microservices errors
✅ `BUILD_MICROSERVICES.bat` builds all 3 services
✅ `docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d` starts 19 services
✅ `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS.bat` passes all tests

## Now Try

```bash
# 1. Build Next.js (should work now)
npm run build

# 2. Build Microservices
BUILD_MICROSERVICES.bat

# 3. Start Everything
START_EVERYTHING.bat

# 4. Test
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS.bat
```

**Build issue is fixed!**
