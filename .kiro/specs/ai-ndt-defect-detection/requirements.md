# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-driven Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) defect detection system addresses the critical gap in affordable, fast, and reliable defect detection for manufacturing components. This system will leverage artificial intelligence to analyze images and videos of components, providing automated defect detection capabilities that are accessible to small manufacturers who currently cannot afford traditional NDT solutions requiring skilled experts and expensive equipment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a small manufacturer, I want to upload images or videos of components for automated defect analysis, so that I can detect defects without requiring expensive equipment or specialized expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP)
2. WHEN a user uploads a video file THEN the system SHALL accept common video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV)
3. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file size limits and format compatibility
4. IF an unsupported file format is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an error message with supported formats
5. WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display upload progress and confirmation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality control manager, I want the AI system to automatically detect and classify defects in component images, so that I can quickly identify problematic parts without manual inspection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is processed THEN the system SHALL analyze it for common defects (cracks, corrosion, deformation, surface irregularities)
2. WHEN defects are detected THEN the system SHALL classify each defect by type and severity level
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL highlight defect locations on the original image
4. WHEN multiple defects are found THEN the system SHALL provide a prioritized list based on severity
5. IF no defects are detected THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the component passed inspection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a manufacturing engineer, I want to receive detailed defect reports with confidence scores, so that I can make informed decisions about component acceptance or rejection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defect analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report
2. WHEN defects are identified THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores (0-100%) for each detection
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include defect coordinates, dimensions, and affected area percentages
4. WHEN a report is created THEN the system SHALL allow export in multiple formats (PDF, JSON, CSV)
5. IF confidence scores are below a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL flag results for manual review

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a small business owner, I want an affordable and user-friendly interface, so that I can implement defect detection without extensive training or technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the system THEN the interface SHALL be intuitive and require minimal training
2. WHEN using the system THEN users SHALL be able to complete defect analysis in under 5 minutes per component
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators and plain language explanations
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance for resolution
5. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL display clear status updates and estimated completion times

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance specialist, I want to customize defect detection parameters for different component types, so that I can optimize accuracy for my specific manufacturing processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up component profiles THEN the system SHALL allow customization of defect sensitivity levels
2. WHEN configuring detection parameters THEN the system SHALL support different material types (metal, plastic, composite, ceramic)
3. WHEN creating profiles THEN the system SHALL allow specification of critical defect types for each component category
4. WHEN profiles are saved THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate settings automatically based on component selection
5. IF custom parameters are set THEN the system SHALL validate settings and warn of potential accuracy impacts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a production manager, I want to process multiple components in batch mode, so that I can efficiently analyze large quantities of parts during production runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading multiple files THEN the system SHALL support batch processing of up to 100 images or 10 videos
2. WHEN batch processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL process files in parallel to minimize total processing time
3. WHEN batch analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of all processed components
4. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL allow pausing and resuming of operations
5. IF any files fail processing THEN the system SHALL continue with remaining files and report failures separately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to maintain audit trails and historical records of all defect inspections, so that I can demonstrate quality control processes to regulatory bodies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inspections are performed THEN the system SHALL automatically log all analysis activities with timestamps
2. WHEN storing records THEN the system SHALL maintain original images, analysis results, and user actions
3. WHEN generating audit reports THEN the system SHALL provide searchable inspection history by date, component type, or defect type
4. WHEN exporting audit data THEN the system SHALL support standard compliance formats
5. IF data retention policies are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or delete records according to specified timeframes
